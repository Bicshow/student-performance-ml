# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores the **Student Performance Dataset** to predict math scores using various features like reading and writing scores, gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course. It involves:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Visualization of results

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains student records including:

- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course
- Math, Reading, Writing scores

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand relationships between student attributes and math scores
- Use ML to predict math scores
- Visualize key insights using correlation heatmaps and scatter plots

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved an R² Score of **0.75** using Linear Regression.
- Reading and writing scores are the most correlated with math performance.
- Heatmap showed strong multicollinearity between reading & writing.
